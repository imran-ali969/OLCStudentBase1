# Task 2 
# The following program is written for prospective customers 
# of a painting services company. 
# 
# The program provides a price quotation for the 
# painting services after customers enter their selection.

# 7	The company will extend their services to 5-room apartments. 
#   5-room apartments consist of 5 rooms in total.
#   Edit the program so that it allows users of 5-room apartments 
#   to enter that as a selection.	[2]

#==========================================================
# 8	The company has just added a third paint package 
#   “Premier all-in-one” to its existing list of services. 
#   Edit the program so that it allows users to select the 
#   “Premier all-in-one” package. The base cost of the package is $2200.	[2]

    j += 1





#==========================================================
# 9	The customer is required to enter the colour codes for all the rooms. 
#   The colour code must be an integer between 1 to 58 (inclusive). 
#   Edit the program so that it validates the colour code entry and 
#   prompts for the colour code to be entered again each time 
#   an invalid colour code is entered.	[4]
#==========================================================






#==========================================================
# 10	The total cost of the painting service package 
#   includes the base cost and a variable cost. 
#   The variable cost depends on the total number of rooms to be painted,
#   with $120 charged per room to the total cost. 

#   Edit the program so that it computes the total package price 
#   and displays it at the end of the program.	[2]
