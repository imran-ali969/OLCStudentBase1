# Task 4

# The task is to edit a program that helps the management committee of a condominium to monitor
# the movement of vehicles in their property.

# The following program shows a dictionary stored in database that contains the following information:
# (i) vehicle owner's names as the dictionary key
# (ii) four values stored in a list:
# > nationality,
# > address block,
# > age and
# > whether the vehicle is 4-wheel (4W) or 2-wheel (2W).

"Charlie":["US","BLK 32", 23, "4W"],
"David":["SG","BLK 32", 24, "4W"],
"Emily":["IN","BLK 32", 35, "4W"],
"Frank":["SG","BLK 32", 37, "4W"],
"Grace":["UK","BLK 32", 29, "2W"],
"Henry":["CN","BLK 32", 72, "2W"],
"Ivy":["SG","BLK 32", 66, "2W"],
"Jack":["SG","BLK 32", 58, "2W"],

# Task 4.1
# Edit the program so that it prints all the information (key and values) in the dictionary.
# Save your program. [1]
#-----------------------------------------------
for i in database:
    print(f"{i}, {database[i]}") 




#-----------------------------------------------
# Task 4.2
# Copy and paste the program from Task 4.1.
# Edit the program so that it:
# (a) requests the user to enter a name to be used as the dictionary key; and
# (b) prints only the vehicle type corresponding to the name entered. Assume the names
# entered are present in the dictionary.
# [2]
# Save your program.

#     value = database[name]
#     vehicle = value[3]
#     print(f"{name} vehicle type: {vehicle}")
# for i in database:
#     print(f"{i}, {database[i]}") 




#-----------------------------------------------
# Task 4.3
# Copy and paste the program from Task 4.2
# Edit the program so that it only accepts a name input if the name entered is found in the
# dictionary. If the username is not found, a suitable error message must be displayed.
# The program must loop until the username entry can be found and prints the vehicle type
# corresponding to the name entered
# Save your JupyterLab notebook for Task 4.
